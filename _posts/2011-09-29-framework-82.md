*Let's Make a Framework* is an ongoing series about building a JavaScript framework from the ground up.

These articles are tagged with [lmaf](http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmaf). The project we're creating is called [Turing](http://github.com/alexyoung/turing.js). Documentation is available at [turingjs.com](http://turingjs.com/).

Last week in [Asynchronous Resource Loading](http://dailyjs.com/2011/09/22/framework-81/) I introduced some popular script loading libraries, and discussed how recent web standards aim to give us more control over how scripts are loaded. This week I want to explain how to programatically load scripts asynchronously in a way that supports legacy browsers.

Resource loading can be split into three main concerns:

1.  Controlling how things are loaded
2.  Providing an API
3.  Supporting legacy browsers

Each script loader that I looked at seemed to place a different emphasis on each of these areas. [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) has a lot of code for its module-based API; [LABjs](http://labjs.com/) has a simpler chained API which is a little more focused on the first problem.

### Script Insertion

In [Loading Scripts Without Blocking](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/27/loading-scripts-without-blocking/) by Steve Souders, various non-blocking loading techniques are compared. Steve summarises with the following

> In many situations, the Script DOM Element is a good choice. It works in all browsers, doesn't have any cross-site scripting restrictions, is fairly simple to implement, and is well understood. The one catch is that it doesnâ€™t preserve execution order across all browsers.

Inserting <code>script</code> tags is the approach most libraries use for basic asynchronous script loading. Preserving order is problematic and requires the use of several different solutions to accomplish it.

The most basic script insertion technique looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
(function(global) {
  var appendTo = document.head || document.getElementsByTagName('head');

  function require(scriptSrc, fn) {
    var script = document.createElement('script');

    script.type = 'text/javascript';
    script.src = scriptSrc;
    script.onload = fn;

    appendTo.insertBefore(script, appendTo.firstChild);
  }

  turing.require = require;
}(window));
{% endhighlight %}

The handling of <code>appendTo</code> is based on [LAB.src.js](https://github.com/getify/LABjs/blob/master/LAB.src.js). To create a suitable unit test, I've used the Turing Ajax test harness. The test itself just needs to ensure JavaScript gets loaded and executed as expected:

{% highlight javascript %}
'test require': function() {
  $t.require('/load-me.js', function() {
    assert.equal(loadMeDone, 1);
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

The <code>load-me.js</code> script sets a global, <code>loadMeDone</code>, and the assertion tests for this. The script's <code>onload</code> method will be set to this callback.

### Internet Explorer Support

Internet Explorer provides an <code>onreadystatechange</code> property instead of <code>onload</code>. That means the script element's <code>readyState</code> has to be checked.

{% highlight javascript %}
(function(global) {
  var appendTo = document.head || document.getElementsByTagName('head');

  function require(scriptSrc, fn) {
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    script.type = 'text/javascript';
    script.src = scriptSrc;

    script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = function() {
      if (!script.readyState || (script.readyState === 'complete' || script.readyState === 'loaded')) {
        script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = null;
        fn();
        appendTo.removeChild(script);
      }
    };

    appendTo.insertBefore(script, appendTo.firstChild);
  }

  turing.require = require;
}(window));
{% endhighlight %}

This creates an onload/onreadystatechange callback that should work in both Internet Explorer and standards-compliant browsers. However, running the test produces an error raised on the <code>insertBefore</code> line that inserts the script tag. After looking at [LAB.src.js](https://github.com/getify/LABjs/blob/master/LAB.src.js) I realised it was because the document isn't yet ready, which means we need a way of deferring until <code>appendTo.firstChild</code> is available.

The easiest way to do this is by using <code>setTimeout</code>:

{% highlight javascript %}
(function(global) {
  var appendTo = document.head || document.getElementsByTagName('head');

  function require(scriptSrc, fn) {
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    script.type = 'text/javascript';
    script.src = scriptSrc;

    script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = function() {
      if (!script.readyState || (script.readyState === 'complete' || script.readyState === 'loaded')) {
        script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = null;
        fn();
        appendTo.removeChild(script);
      }
    };

    appendTo.insertBefore(script, appendTo.firstChild);
  }

  turing.require = function(scriptSrc, fn) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      if ('item' in appendTo) {
        if (!appendTo[0]) {
          return setTimeout(arguments.callee, 25);
        }

        appendTo = appendTo[0];
      }

      require(scriptSrc, fn);
    });
  };
}(window));
{% endhighlight %}

The callback will keep calling itself and returning until <code>appendTo\[0\]</code> is available. At this point execution will continue to call the original <code>require</code> function.

### Conclusion

This example only illustrates loading scripts by inserting script tags. There's no way to control the order the scripts are executed, and there isn't any HTML5 support.
