<div class="intro">
*Let's Make a Framework* is an ongoing series about building a JavaScript framework from the ground up.

These articles are tagged with [lmaf](http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmaf). The project we're creating is called [Turing](http://github.com/alexyoung/turing.js). Documentation is available at [turingjs.com](http://turingjs.com/).

</div>
I was impressed by the [Superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) HTTP library, so I decided to see what improvements I could make to <code>turing.net</code> based on it. Along the way I found some IE compatibility issues that I hadn't spotted before, and improved the functional testing script.

### Response and Requests

Both [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and Superagent pass abstracted response and request objects back to callbacks. I found the need for this arose when I noticed IE6 didn't like me adding properties to the <code>ActiveXObject</code> it uses to support <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>. To fix this I decided to take some inspiration from these projects and provide an abstracted response object to callbacks:

{% highlight javascript %}
var response = {};

response.status = request.status;
response.responseText = request.responseText;
if (/json/.test(contentType)) {
  response.responseJSON = net.parseJSON(request.responseText);
} else if (/xml/.test(contentType)) {
  response.responseXML = net.parseXML(request.responseText);
}

if (successfulRequest(request)) {
  if (options.success) options.success(response, request);
  if (promise) promise.resolve(response, request);
} else {
  if (options.error) options.error(response, request);
  if (promise) promise.reject(response, request);
}

{% endhighlight %}

Now the callbacks get a more friendly response object, as well as the original <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> request object. The JSON and XML tests were also added here -- previously only JSON was parsed, but I added support for XML as well.

### Parsing XML

In [Parsing and serializing XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Parsing_and_serializing_XML) on MDN, the following fragment is suggested for parsing XML:

{% highlight javascript %}
var theString='<a id="a"><b id="b">hey!</b></a>';
var parser = new DOMParser();
var dom = parser.parseFromString(theString, "text/xml");
// print the name of the root element or error message
dump(dom.documentElement.nodeName == "parsererror" ? "error while parsing" : dom.documentElement.nodeName);
{% endhighlight %}

The resulting XML isn't parsed into a plain JavaScript <code>Object</code> but a <code>Document</code> instead, which means methods and properties like <code>nodeName</code> are available.

Microsoft's approach is again to use <code>ActiveXObject</code>:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Instantiate a DOM object at run time.
var dom = new ActiveXObject("msxml2.DOMDocument.6.0");
dom.async = false;
dom.resolveExternals = false;
dom.loadXML("<a>A</a>");
{% endhighlight %}

This is from [InstantiateDOM.js at MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms764708(v=vs.85).aspx).

I decided to define a <code>parseXML</code> method once based on browser support:

{% highlight javascript %}
  /**
    * Parses XML represented as a string.
    *
    * @param {String} string The original string
    * @returns {Object} A JavaScript object
    */
  if (window.DOMParser) {
    net.parseXML = function(text) {
      return new DOMParser().parseFromString(text, 'text/xml');
    };
  } else {
    net.parseXML = function(text) {
      var xml = new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLDOM');
      xml.async = 'false';
      xml.loadXML(text);
      return xml;
    };
  }
{% endhighlight %}

To test this, I wrote the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
'test xml parsing': function() {
  $t.post('/give-me-xml', {
    contentType: 'application/xml',
    success: function(r) {
      assert.equal('key', r.responseXML.documentElement.nodeName);
    }
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

This runs through an Express app, in [test/functional/ajax.js](https://github.com/alexyoung/turing.js/blob/master/test/functional/ajax.js).

### Promises

As I mentioned, IE doesn't like modifying the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object it provides through ActiveX. I was setting a <code>then</code> property on request objects to support [promises](http://dailyjs.com/2011/06/02/framework-65/) which was only used because the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> was being returned from the network-related methods. To get around the IE issue, I decided just to return an empty object with a <code>then</code> property, so this is still possible:

{% highlight javascript %}
$t.get('/get-test').then(
  function(r) { assert.equal('Sample text', r.responseText); },
  function(r) { assert.ok(false); }
);
{% endhighlight %}

I made the documentation slightly ambiguous about what the network methods return because I suspect returning the current <code>turing</code> object to allow other chaining might be more useful. It currently reads <code>@returns {Object} An object for further chaining with promises</code>, which is what I intended it to do in the first place.

### Conclusion

After all that, I never really got to use any of TJ's ideas from Superagent, other than abstracting response objects. The most important thing to remember when creating cross-browser code is to be careful about extending native objects. That's a good rule of thumb for JavaScript in general, and I feel doubly embarrassed about doing it in the first place because I've been preaching this for a while!
