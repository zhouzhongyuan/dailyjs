*Let's Make a Framework* is an ongoing series about building a JavaScript framework from the ground up.

These articles are tagged with [lmaf](http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#lmaf). The project we're creating is called [Turing](http://github.com/alexyoung/turing.js). Documentation is available at [turingjs.com](http://turingjs.com/).

[Last week's post](http://dailyjs.com/2011/06/02/framework-65/) introduced the concept of *promises*, which are defined by the CommonJS [Promises/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A) specification.

### Implementation Concepts

It's important to realise that implementing promises requires some coupling or wrapping between the promise library and code that will use it. For example, in jQuery, [deferred.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/deferred.js) contains the promise API implementation. That doesn't mean Ajax requests can now simply be manipulated to work with a promise, like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
// This won't work:
promiseLibrary($.get('/example')).then(function() {
  // Ajax complete!
});
{% endhighlight %}

There's no way for <code>promiseLibrary</code> to be signalled by a given method in a generic way.

This next example is from [q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) for Node. It wraps promises around a file system call:

{% highlight javascript %}
var FS = require('fs');

function list(path) {
  path = String(path);
  var result = Q.defer();
  FS.readdir(path, function(error, list) {
    if (error)
      return result.reject(error);
    else
      result.resolve(list);
  });
  return result.promise;
}

list('/path/name');
{% endhighlight %}

Here <code>Q</code> is used inside the callback usually called by the <code>fs</code> module. This new <code>list()</code> method will return a promise, allowing subsequent use of q's <code>when</code> primitive to build potentially more expressive file system queries.

What all of this means is jQuery's [ajax.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js) is *coupled* to the promise implementation. This allows jQuery to offer an alternative API based around promises:

{% highlight javascript %}
$.get('test').then(
  function() { alert('$.get succeeded'); },
  function() { alert('$.get failed!'); }
);
{% endhighlight %}

Despite this coupling between the Promise and Ajax libraries, injecting jQuery's <code>Deferred</code> objects into the Ajax library isn't particularly taxing. Here's a core piece of this implementation:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Success/Error
if ( isSuccess ) {
  deferred.resolveWith( callbackContext, [ success, statusText, jqXHR ] );
} else {
  deferred.rejectWith( callbackContext, [ jqXHR, statusText, error ] );
}
{% endhighlight %}

jQuery's public APIs place a veneer between jQuery's other functionality and the <code>Deferred</code> object's API. Using an Ajax call looks a lot like CommonJS Promises/A's suggestion, but in reality methods like <code>resolveWith</code> and <code>rejectWith</code> are being used underneath to provide the logic required to maintain asynchronous states.

### An Example

I'm going to introduce promises gently, because it's the kind of thing that can easily end up a confusing mess. The example in this article is intentionally limited so anyone should be able to follow it.

Developing a promise API needs a straightforward example to get the basic features nailed down. We need to be able to create a delay that can trigger the promise API in a predictable way. When experimenting with anything asynchronous, I always find good old <code>setTimeout</code> to be a big help, so let's use that:

{% highlight javascript %}
function delay(ms) {
  var d = new Promise();
  setTimeout(d.resolve, ms);
  return d;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is based on q's examples, and it just wraps <code>setTimeout</code> with a promise. Ideally, running the following in an interpreter should take a second, *then* display the message:

{% highlight javascript %}
delay(1000).then(function() {
  console.log('Delay complete');
});
{% endhighlight %}

However... once a promise has fired, it shouldn't be able to get triggered again. Imagine if someone had implemented a timeout system like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
function timeout(duration, limit) {
  var d = new Promise();
  setTimeout(d.resolve, duration);

  // If the duration was over the limit then ideally the promise should fail
  setTimeout(d.reject, limit);
  return d;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Should both callbacks fire? Should an exception be thrown? Well, jQuery is designed to simply clear out the *then* callbacks as it rattles through them:

{% highlight javascript %}
// resolve with given context and args
resolveWith: function( context, args ) {
  if ( !cancelled && !fired && !firing ) {
    // make sure args are available (#8421)
    args = args || [];
    firing = 1;
    try {
      while( callbacks[ 0 ] ) {
        callbacks.shift().apply( context, args );
      }
      // ...
{% endhighlight %}

See that use of <code>shift()</code> there? That's effectively looping through each callback, running it, then removing it.

### A Promise Object

Of course, our promise API isn't just a stack of callbacks. We also need to store state, and allow callbacks to be added. To me this implies a class with a simple API:

{% highlight javascript %}
function Promise() {
  // Pending callbacks
  this.pending = [];
}

Promise.prototype = {
  // Called when something finished successfully
  resolve: function(result) {
    // This is where we'll loop through callbacks
  },

  // Called when something broke
  reject: function(result) {
  },

  // I think you'll agree that implementing then is pretty easy
  // This uses a handy object that follows along with our API nicely
  then: function(success, failure) {
    this.pending.push({ resolve: success, reject: failure });
    return this;
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

That's looking good, but I want to use <code>setTimeout(promise.resolve, 100)</code> and that will cause <code>resolve</code> to have the wrong <code>this</code>. These methods could easily be moved to the constructor to make the <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> methods behave more naturally:

{% highlight javascript %}
function Promise() {
  var self = this;
  this.pending = [];

  this.resolve = function(result) {
    self.complete('resolve', result);
  },

  this.reject = function(result) {
    self.complete('reject', result);
  }
}

Promise.prototype = {
  then: function(success, failure) {
    this.pending.push({ resolve: success, reject: failure });
    return this;
  },

  complete: function(type, result) {
    while (this.pending[0]) {
      this.pending.shift()[type](result);
    }
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

I also started writing some tests for this:

{% highlight javascript %}
function delay(ms) {
  var p = new Promise();
  setTimeout(p.resolve, ms);
  return p;
}

function timeout(duration, limit) {
  var p = new Promise();
  setTimeout(p.resolve, duration);
  setTimeout(p.reject, limit);
  return p;
}

delay(1000).then(function() {
  console.log('Delay complete');
  assert.ok('Delay completed');
});

timeout(10, 100).then(
  function() {
    console.log('Timeout 1 OK');
    assert.ok('10ms is under 100ms');
  },
  function() {
    assert.fail();
  }
);

timeout(100, 10).then(
  function() {
    assert.fail();
  },
  function() {
    console.log('Timeout 2 OK');
    assert.ok('100ms is over 10ms');
  }
);
{% endhighlight %}

### Conclusion

This is a very naive implementation of what CommonJS Promises/A describes. Ultimately, I'd like to have something that can be used to provide an elegant API for Ajax callbacks and animations, which are both areas in client-side JavaScript where asynchronous code is important.
